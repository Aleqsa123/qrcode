## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge was to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I used tools mentioned below to  complete the challenge. 
Users are able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
I added footnotes about challenge source and author of the code.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned laying the elements out, use and insert google fonts. How to insert meta element in html index document for responsive desing usage.

Below are the codes I used, and I think that these are awesome at my level of education in web-development:

```html
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```

### Continued development

I have to work more on CSS layout, because for me this was the hardest part of the challenge. Paddings and margins wee also challenge.
